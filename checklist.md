## Adding a New Endpoint

#### Create Tests

* Create dummy tests for the endpoint so we can meet the requirements of test-driven development (TDD).

* Create routes, run tests
* Create controllers, export controller from index.js, run tests
* Create/add middleware, run tests (when creating middleware, create tests for them too)
* Add API documentation to routes
* Add JsDoc to controllers
